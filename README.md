## 🏆 How It Works  
This Python script is a simple **Guess the Number** game where the player tries to guess a randomly chosen number between 1 and 100.  

### 🔢 Game Flow:
1. The computer selects a **random number** between 1 and 100.
2. The player enters a guess, and the game provides feedback:
   - **"Too low!"** if the guess is smaller than the number.
   - **"Too high!"** if the guess is larger than the number.
   - **"Congratulations!"** when the correct number is guessed.
3. The game **counts the number of attempts** and displays it when the player wins.
4. If a non-numeric input is entered, the game prompts the player to enter a valid number.

### 🛠 Features:
✔️ Simple, interactive command-line game
